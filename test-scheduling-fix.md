# Test Apply-Scheduling Fix

This is a test file to verify that the apply-scheduling job condition fix works correctly.

## Expected Behavior

When this PR is labeled with `target:scheduling`:

- apply-keeping should be skipped (should_run_keeping=false)
- apply-scheduling should run (should_run_scheduling=true)
- apply-scheduling job should execute successfully

## Test Date

2025-08-11

## Changes Made

- Fixed apply-scheduling job condition to handle when apply-keeping is skipped
- Added explicit check for `should_run_keeping == 'false'`
- Enhanced debug logging

This file can be deleted after testing is complete.
